"""skvoice ⇄ skcapstone — optional integration adapter.

skvoice runs fully standalone.  When the ``skcapstone`` package is installed
(and the operator has not forced standalone mode with ``SK_STANDALONE=1``),
this adapter routes alerts through skcapstone's shared **sk-alert** bus and
registers skvoice's health-check / TTS-cache prune with the fleet
**skscheduler**, so the whole sk* mesh sees one alert stream and one
scheduler.  When skcapstone is absent, every call degrades to skvoice's
native behaviour (structured logging + the systemd ``skvoice.service`` unit).

This is the *default-on-by-presence* pattern from
``skcapstone/docs/ADR-optional-integration-backbone.md`` — nothing here is a
hard dependency; ``skcapstone`` lives in the optional ``[skcapstone]`` extra.

Public API:
    is_present()                      -> bool
    alert(event, payload, level)      -> bool   (True iff sent via sk-alert)
    ensure_schedule(interval_hours)   -> bool   (True iff registered with skscheduler)
    unregister_schedule()             -> bool
    register_self(pid_file)           -> bool
